glasso.py: the program to generate a graph based on the provided data set
Input: a csv file with rows being samples and columns being features
Output: a csv file that contains a matrix which describes the parameters of each clique (node/edge). 
(The element (i, j) represents the parameter/weight on edge (Xi, Xj), and if i=j then it represents the parameter for node Xi)

example.csv: variables generated as the data set for testing
generating rules:
X1: = {1 (p=0.5)
       0 (p=0.5)
X2-X10: Xi = {Xi-1 (p=0.75)
              -Xi-1 (p=0.25)
X11: = {X1 and X2 (p=0.9)
        -X1 and X2 (p=0.1)
etc.
(X15-X20 are totally independent to other variables)

graph.csv: the graph generated based on the data provided in example.csv
